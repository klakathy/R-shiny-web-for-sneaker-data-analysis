This is a group project for a course. A website is made with R Shiny App to analyze and visualize the data of sneaker sellings.

The data used is collected from StockX.com with Python. Main part of the code is attached to google colab [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1X7_NjXMkxWrZ7Vsg5v1mqoLNozjMCpuy). The same file can be seen as stockx_data.ipynb.
<br/><br/>
